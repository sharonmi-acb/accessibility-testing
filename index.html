    <title>Accessibility Test: Long Headings with ARIA</title>

    <h1>Welcome to the Accessibility Testing Page</h1>
    <!-- Short heading -->

    <h2>Short Heading Example</h2>
    <!-- Short heading -->

    <h3>
      This is a long heading that contains more than 150 characters to test how
      the rule evaluates overly verbose headings and their impact on
      accessibility tools like screen readers and navigation.
    </h3>
    <!-- Long heading -->

    <h4>
      Another Example of a Long Heading: This heading is specifically designed
      to go beyond the character limit for testing purposes and to ensure
      accurate results for accessibility evaluations.
    </h4>
    <!-- Long heading -->

    <div role="heading" aria-level="3">
      This is a short heading defined with a div using ARIA attributes.
    </div>
    <!-- Short heading with ARIA -->

    <span role="heading" aria-level="4"
      >This is another ARIA heading example, but it is long and goes beyond the
      150-character threshold, designed to test ARIA-based headings with
      excessive length.</span
    >
    <!-- Long heading with ARIA -->

    <h5>Brief Heading</h5>
    <!-- Short heading -->

    <h6>
      A medium-length heading that is just under the 150-character limit for
      balance and testing purposes
    </h6>
    <!-- Medium heading -->

    <div role="heading" aria-level="2">
      Another ARIA heading defined using a div with appropriate heading level.
    </div>
    <!-- ARIA heading -->

    <p>
      Use the above examples to evaluate how long and short headings affect
      screen readers and whether long headings are flagged appropriately.
